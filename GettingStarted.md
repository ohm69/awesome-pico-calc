### Steps to Update STM32
1. Turn off the PicoCalc and take out the batteries.
2. Open the back of the PicoCalc carefully
3. Turn on switch 1 (SW701) (just below the SD-card)
4. Connect a `USB-C` to your Computer and to your PicoCalc
5. Hold the power button to turn on your PicoCalc
6. Start the STM32CubeProgrammer (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) on your computer
7. Select `UART` (light blue drop-down at the top right)
8. Click `Connect` (green button at the top right)
9. Click the `Open file` tab and select `PicoCalc_BIOS_v1.4.bin` (Download from https://github.com/clockworkpi/PicoCalc/tree/master/Bin)
10. Press the light blue `Download` button
11. Once finished, click `Disconnect` then unplug the `USB-C` cable from your PicoCalc
12. Turn off switch 1 (SW701)

## Flashing New Firmware
Custom firmware can enhance the functionality of your PicoCalc. You can flash new firmware to add features or update existing ones.

Here's a video guide for visual assistance: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-EXSRHOsfQ&pp=ygUIamJsYW5rZWQ%3D).

### Steps to Flash New Firmware

1. **Download** the firmware file you want to flash.

2. **Put your PicoCalc into bootloader mode:**

   * Connect the micro-USB cable to your computer.
   * While holding down the **BOOTSEL** button on the Raspberry Pi Pico inside your PicoCalc, connect the other end of the cable to your **Raspberry Pi Pico**.

     > 💡 *Beginner Tip:* You don’t need to open the back of the PicoCalc to reach the BOOTSEL button. Use something small and non-metallic—like a wooden toothpick—to press the button through the hole on the back.

3. **Wait for your computer to recognize** the PicoCalc as a mass storage device (it will appear like a USB drive).

4. **Copy** the firmware file to the root directory of the PicoCalc (just drag and drop the file into the drive).

5. **Eject** the PicoCalc from your computer safely, then unplug and power it on to restart with the new firmware.
